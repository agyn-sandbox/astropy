Adding a structured numpy ndarray as a Table column now emits a FutureWarning. The implicit auto-conversion to ``astropy.table.NdarrayMixin`` is deprecated and will change in Astropy 5.2: structured ndarrays will be added as a plain ``Column`` without auto-conversion. To adopt the future behavior now (and silence the warning), wrap the array in ``astropy.table.Column`` before adding. If you rely on the current ``NdarrayMixin`` behavior, wrap explicitly (e.g., using ``astropy.table.NdarrayMixin``). [#PR-NUMBER]
